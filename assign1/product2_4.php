                        United States to ensure that their high quality standards are met. This cello is outfitted with hard and soft cases (making it convenient to
                        carry to school or orchestra), a Brazilwood bow with unbleached horsehair, cello stand, rosin cake, and an extra set of cello strings. </p>
