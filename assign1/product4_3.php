                <li>Description
                    <p>Ton-tom drums are drums with no snare cables, named using the Anglo-Indian and Sinhala languages. Most toms ranges from 6in to 20in in diameter, but floor toms are an exception that go as far as 24in. The CT-9000 Series Yamaha tom-toms are a perfect choice for a classical concert use, or for any performance perhaps. With proportional sizing, oak shells and the YES III Mount System, it gives this music the balance and an extraordinary range of expressivity.</p>
