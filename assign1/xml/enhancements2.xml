        <h2>List of enhancements</h2>
  <!--
        <ol>
            <li>Embedding External Content in aboutme pages. <a href="aboutme3.html#about_address">link to enhancement (aboutme1.html)</a>
              <p>The maps makes use of iframes, an element tag that allows pages to display another page within it by using a url. To display the map with locations,
                a url to google map's website with the location is used.</p>
              <p>The maps links are found with the help of this website. <a href="https://www.embedgooglemap.net/" target='_blank'>https://www.embedgooglemap.net/</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>Audio in index using audio element tag. <a href="index.html#audio">link to enhancement (index.html)</a>
              <p>The audio tag is a html5 element tag not covered in Labs. The audio tag links to a downloaded audio in the audio file, which can be played with the controls from the tag.
                The audio helps motivate and interest people into learning to play musical intruments or start playing them again, or generally for the users to have a better experience and
                leave a stronger impression on the website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>CSS grids to layout elements. <a href="product1.html">link to enhancement (product1.html)</a>
              <p>The products are layouted with grids within only css. This gives more control over how each inline-block elements are positioned under a grid container without having to change
                the html file as often, while being fluid as the page scales. Similar layouts were used in index, aboutus, and throughout the product pages in place of html tables.
                This was not covered in Labs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>CSS properties or selectors not taught in tutorials. <a href="#productlist">link to enhancement (nav bar)</a>
			         <p>The CSS selector ::after was used in the nav bar on every page to add and customise symbols and content after 'product' of the nav bar, and after every drop down product option.
			            The ::after selector adds content after every reiteration of the selected element. This selector was not covered in Labs.</p>
			      </li>
        </ol>
  -->


        <ol>
            <li>Using regular expression patterns to validate data  <a href="enquiry.html#email">link to enhancement (enquiry.html)</a>
                <p>The input values for email and phone number in our enquiry page are tested against regular expressions in our javascript code. Email is tested to make sure that it contains @ and .com, while phone number is tested to only contain numbers. The enhancement code is integrated into the original js code to validate email and phone inputs.</p>
                <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>Using HTML Form Elements to validate the form  <a href="enquiry.html#product">link to enhancement (enquiry.html)</a>
                <p>The js code in the enquiry form uses form elements to get the value in different inputs and validate them. The js code for the drop down menus also use form elements to manipulate the text content, value, or attributes of the options in the drop down menus. The enhancement code is integrated into the original js code in the drop down functions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Pop up preview <a href="enquiry.html">link to enhancement (enquiry.html)</a>
                <p>When the user clicks on submit, the js code will display the users inputted values and prompt the user one last time for confirmation to submit, or to cancel and change the form inputs. The enhancement code is integrated into the original js file's form validation code to minimise file size since the file validation code has variables needed for the enhancement code. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Slideshow on index page <a href="index.html">link to enhancement (index.html)</a>
                <p>The enhancement code creates a slideshow of images on the index page that changes images once every 3 seconds. A timer runs the change function every 3000 miliseconds. The change function changes the background image of the banner.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Highlight current page in nav bar <a href="">link to enhancement (index.html)</a>
                <p>The nav bar highlights the link the user is in with a yellow background. The js file finds the url of the current page and compares it with the url of each nav anchor href. If they match, it will be highlighted. The script also works with product pages and subproduct pages at the drop down nav.</p>
