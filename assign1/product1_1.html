                <li>Description
                    <p>The BTR-300 Bb Trumpet is a student grade trumpet that would give the students the confidence to grow into proud musicians, especially for those who just started learning the basics of the trumpet. The Bundy BTR-300 &#40;the
                        full name of the trumpet&#41;, has a large bore which makes it easier for beginners to blow. As student performances may not be done right, taxing the trumpet itself, the BTR-300 is built to stand up to those demands. The main tuning slide is reinforced as for it to be more durable and the receiver tubes are made with nickle silver to help prevent corrosion, decreasing the need for professional maintenece and repairs.</p>

                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>Due to it being more suited to students rather than professionals or for performances, the rental price for the Bundy BTR-300 could be rented for just RM120 a month, saving cost for the aspiring trumpet student. The base price of the BTR-300 is RM2145, meaning the student could rent it for a whole year and still be saving money compared to going out and buying it on his or her own.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                    <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
