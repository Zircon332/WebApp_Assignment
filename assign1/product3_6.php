                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>At USD2445, or RM10000, the piccolo, due to its need for careful craftmanship and professional status, is quite a hefty fee, even for a professional instrument. But it is all worth it for the serious musicians who would want to take their performance up to the next level, even more so for soloists, as this is one of the best piccolos out there.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                    <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
