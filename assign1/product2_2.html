                <li>Description
                    <p>Originating in the 19th century, ukeleles are the Hawaiian versions of the Portuguese machete &#40;small guitars&#41; introduced by
                        Portuguese immigrants going into the region. It usually consists of four nylon or gut strings or four courses of strings. Some strings
                        may be paired in courses, giving the instrument a total of six or eight strings. The Kala KA-15S ukelele is well known for its amazing
                        quality and sound, all in an affordable price range. This model is perfect for beginner players who want to try their hand on ukeleles,
                        or for experienced players who want just want a reliable ukelele to perform with.</p>

                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>The Ukelele is one of the cheapest instruments one can find on the market, with the general price staying at USD30, which is around RM120 when converted. This particular ukelele though, is more geared towards beginners who want to practice and learn how to play, instead of more experience and advance players. As stated above, this is more of a collector's item for the already experienced.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                    <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
