                <li>Description
                    <p>Similar to its alto saxophone conterpart, it has elements from professional and custom saxophone models, but this time, its from tenor saxaphones. The YTS-26 is a beginner level tenor saxophone that would help any student get used to the ways of this particular instrument. The YTS-26 tenor saxophone, like the YAS-26, contains an improved low B to C# connection that ensures the consistent closing of the low C# key and promotes a clear response from the notes, as found in other more professional saxophones.</p>

                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>Saxophones are no doubt one of the more complicated instruments in the world, with specific designs and builds to keep them fuctional. Eventhough the YTS-26 is a student grade, it can still do the job at professional level, and at the base price of USD2734 or RM11000 after conversion, the price of RM550 a month seems much more reasonable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                    <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
