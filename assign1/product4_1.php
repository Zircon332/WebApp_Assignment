                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>Standing at USD1500, or RM6135, the concert bassdrum definitely is not cheap, but compared to other instruments, it is only used in performances and does not require much practice at all. Rental is advised to be during the month of the performance rather than anytime before.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer

If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
