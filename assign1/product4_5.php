                <li>Description
                    <p>The xylophone is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars, that contains pitches on the musical scale, struck by mallets. In orchestral terms, the xylophone is specifically an instrument of somewhat a higher pitch range and drier than a marimba. The YX-135 is made of Padauk wood at an entirely affordable price, with the bars carefully crafted for superb tonal clarity and resonance.</p>
