                <li>Description
                    <p>Different from the usual line up of orchestral instruments, the YEP-202M is a marching Euphonium that offers the mellow and deep tone of a concert Euphonium, due to its large bore, while allowing it be used in a marching band. The YEP-202M Euphonium is innovated countless of times by different players of the instrument, resulting in the instrument being balanced to hold and much more simpler to play. Although suited for marching, it is also convertable, and can be converted between marching and concert, suiting the performer's needs. This particular model also features new hybrid valve guides, decreasing the needs for maintence.</p>

                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>Though requiring much less craftmanship than the french horn, the sheer size of the Euphonium &#40;Not to mention the new guided valves&#41; justifies its pricing of around USD2270, or RM11000. Customers are required to rent by month to let them get used to the weight and style of play of the instrument as it is a marching instrument. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                    <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
