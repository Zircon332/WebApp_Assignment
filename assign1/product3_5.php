                <li>Description
                    <p>For professionals, we've got the clarinet just for you. The YCL-650 is an exellent alternative for all performers with tight budgets. The model is really close to the custom models &#40;Which are more advance than professional models&#41;, with its bell, barrel and toneholes all eerily similar. Instead of plastic, this professional model is made of seasoned Grenadilla wood and features tapered toneholes which are made by hand for percision in intonation and balance in tone.</p>

                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>A professional model is always more expensive than a student model, hence the pricing of this. The professional model uses wood instead of plastic, and is more carefully hand crafted, making its price stay around USD2000, which is RM8000. This is a bargain for those who only want to rent this instrument for specific performances.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                    <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
