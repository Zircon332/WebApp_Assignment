                <li>Description
                    <p>Being the hybrid of student and professional clarinet, the YCL-200ADII incoporates a few special designs and qualities from Yamaha's more professional models of clarinets. Some of these features include a new 65mm barrel design that produces a focused tone and quick response, a new resonance chamber in the bell to aid in projection and intonation, an adjustable thumbrest and also valentino pads that are more durable, easy to repair and less sensitive to temperature change.</p>

                <li>Pricing Explanation
                    <p>Being both somewhat professional and also geared towards students, the pricing of RM280 a month isn't too eye popping as some would think. Getting an instrument that is ready to be used in a performance and for practice would make this instrument a good candidate for a long rent. It's rent price is kind of boosted due to its cost of USD1017, or RM4160.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                    <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p>
